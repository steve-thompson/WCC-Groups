==========

This application was developed as part of a corporate Google Apps migration from Lotus Notes at Warwickshire County Council. Some functionality was lost in the migration and so bespoke application were written to bridge the gap. The technology chosen was Google Apps Script as it offered a rich api to integrate with all Google resources.

For this application in particular, we needed access to the domain Google groups to search and display membership.

The Solution
